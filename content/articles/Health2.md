Exercise promotes the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. These chemicals boost mood and relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, cycling, or even yoga can have long-lasting benefits for mental health.

## Types of Exercise for Mental Clarity



- **Cardio**: Running, swimming, cycling, and brisk walking increase oxygen supply to the brain, improving mood.
- **Strength Training**: Lifting weights or bodyweight exercises helps reduce stress and increase self-esteem.
- **Mindfulness Exercises**: Yoga and tai chi combine physical movement with meditation, calming the mind.

Incorporating exercise into your daily routine can help you manage stress, improve focus, and increase overall happiness.
